## R1: Website Desciption

## Description

Diet Delight is a modern web application designed to enhance the services of Fit Life Gym by offering additional value to its members by providing personalized meal planning and healthy eating guidance. Gym instructors need a tool to help gym members select meals that complement their fitness goals, such as muscle gain, weight loss, or improved endurance.

## Functionality and Features

1. Search Recipes (MVP 1) - The app allows users to search for recipes by selecting dietary categories aligned with their fitness goals (e.g., high-protein for muscle gain, low-carb for weight loss).

2. Print Recipes (MVP 2) - Users can select and print recipes in PDF format, which provides a handy grocery list, or save the file for easy access.

3. Featured Recipes (MVP 3) - The app provides access to a curated list of recommended recipes that allows users to explore and choose appealing options.

4. User Management (Stretch 1) - Users can create their accounts. Registered users can log in, update their profiles and delete their accounts if needed.

5. Save Recipes (Stretch 2) - Registered users can save their favorite recipes for easy retrieval. They can also add or remove recipes from their saved list.

### Reason why Stretch 1 and 2 are not yet implemented

Our current focus is on developing a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers the core functionalities of Diet Delight. This includes ensuring that key features, such as dietary category search and recipe printing, are working seamlessly and providing value to our users.

As part of this focus, we are prioritizing the identification and resolution of any bugs and refactoring components to make the app more reusable and easier to maintain. This foundational work is essential to ensure a smooth and reliable user experience.

While Stretch 1 (User Management) and Stretch 2 (Save Recipes) have not yet been implemented, these features remain a priority for our team. We are committed to continue the development even after the course concludes, as we believe this app can be a valuable tool in our own healthy lifestyle journeys, as well as those of our family and friends. As the app evolves, we will enhance its capabilities, making it an even more powerful resource for meal planning and healthy eating.

## R3: Application Architecture Diagram

![Application Architecture Diagram](./docs/architechture.png)

The frontend of the application renders the user interface and handles user interactions. Users can search for recipes, view detailed recipe information and select recipes to print. The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend server to process user requests and retrieves the data.

The backend communicates with the Edamam API to fetch recipe data when users search for recipes. The API request includes parameters such as dietary categories and the response is processed by the backend before being sent to the front-end.

The backend temporarily saves recipe data retrieved from the third-party Edamam API in the database. This approach is useful to allow for quick access without repeatedly querying the external API. To comply with Edamam’s policy against permanent storage of recipe data, we use MongoDB’s Time-To-Live (TTL) feature to automatically delete the data after 10 minutes.
