### Description

Diet Delight is a modern web application designed to enhance the services of Fit Life Gym by offering personalised meal planning and healthy eating guidance. This app provides a seamless experience for users to discover, save and manage recipes that align with their fitness goals, whether they aim to build muscle, lose weight or improve endurance.

### Purpose

The purpose of Diet Delight is to deliver added value to Fit Life Gym members by integrating meal planning with fitness routines. The app helps users search for recipes based on dietary categories that support specific fitness goals. Users can print selected recipes in PDF format for convenient grocery shopping and meal preparation. Users can also save and manage favorite recipes to ensure easy access and organisation of dietary options.

### Functionality and Features

1. Search Recipes (MVP 1) - The app allows users to search for recipes by selecting dietary categories aligned with their fitness goals (e.g., high-protein for muscle gain, low-carb for weight loss).

2. Print Recipes (MVP 2) - The app enables users to select and print recipes in PDF format which provides a handy grocery list and meal planning guide.

3. Featured Recipes (MVP 3) - The app provides access to a curated list of recommended recipes that allows users to explore and choose appealing options.

4. User Management (Stretch 1) - Users can create their accounts. Registered users can log in, update their profiles and delete their accounts if needed.

5. Save Recipes (Stretch 2) - Registered users can save their favorite recipes for easy retrieval. They can also add or remove recipes from their saved list.

## R3: Application Architecture Diagram

The frontend of the application renders the user interface and handles user interactions. Users can search for recipes, view detailed recipe information and select recipes to print or save. The frontend sends HTTP requests to the backend server to process user requests and retrieves the data.

The backend communicates with the Edamam API to fetch recipe data when users search for recipes. The API request includes parameters such as dietary categories and the response is processed by the backend before being sent to the front-end.

The backend temporarily saves recipe data retrieved from the third-party Edamam API in the database. This is particularly useful for featured recipes which are selected and stored in the database to be quickly accessed by users without repeatedly querying the external API. The database also manages CRUD operations for user accounts and saved recipes.
